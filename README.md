# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Performed Exploratory Data Analysis to understand multiple characteristics of investors and borrowers, and thereby interpret common patterns in which they invest.

The dataset is a recording of people to invest in each other in a way that is financially and socially rewarding. On loans, borrowers list loan requests between $2,000 and $35,000 and individual investors invest as little as $25 in each loan listing they select. Prosper handles the servicing of the loan on behalf of the matched borrowers and investors.
